Defines hypergraph-structured data. In comparison to graph_nets GraphsTuple, we extend
it to Hypergraphs. Mainly shown in other method implementations (e.g. broadcasting)

Based heavily off models implemented in Tensorflow by Deepmind.

Modifications have been made to tailor the description to *hypergraphs*.

===
The main purpose of the `HypergraphsTuple` is to represent multiple hypergraphs with
different shapes and sizes in a way that supports batched processing.

This module first defines the string constants which are used to represent
graph(s) as tuples or dictionaries: `N_NODE, N_EDGE, NODES, EDGES, RECEIVERS,
SENDERS, GLOBALS`.

This representation could typically take the following form, for a batch of
`n_graphs` hypergraphs stored in a `HypergraphsTuple` called hypergraph:
  - N_NODE: The number of nodes per graph. It is a vector of integers with shape
    `[n_graphs]`, such that `graph.N_NODE[i]` is the number of nodes in the i-th
    graph.
  - N_EDGE: The number of edges per graph. It is a vector of integers with shape
    `[n_graphs]`, such that `graph.N_NODE[i]` is the number of edges in the i-th
    graph.
  - NODES: The nodes features. It is either `None` (the graph has no node
    features), or a vector of shape `[n_nodes] + node_shape`, where
    `n_nodes = sum(graph.N_NODE)` is the total number of nodes in the batch of
    graphs, and `node_shape` represents the shape of the features of each node.
    The relative index of a node from the batched version can be recovered from
    the `graph.N_NODE` property. For instance, the second node of the third
    graph will have its features in the
    `1 + graph.N_NODE[0] + graph.N_NODE[1]`-th slot of graph.NODES.
    Observe that having a `None` value for this field does not mean that the
    graphs have no nodes, only that they do not have features.
  - EDGES: The edges features. It is either `None` (the graph has no edge
    features), or a vector of shape `[n_edges] + edge_shape`, where
    `n_edges = sum(graph.N_EDGE)` is the total number of edges in the batch of
    graphs, and `edge_shape` represents the shape of the features of each edge.
    The relative index of an edge from the batched version can be recovered from
    the `graph.N_EDGE` property. For instance, the third edge of the third
    graph will have its features in the `2 + graph.N_EDGE[0] + graph.N_EDGE[1]`-
    th slot of graph.EDGES.
    Observe that having a `None` value for this field does not necessarily mean
    that the graph has no edges, only that they do not have features.
  - RECEIVERS: The indices of the receiver nodes, for each edge. It is either
    `None` (if the graph has no edges), or a matrix of integers of shape
    `[n_edges]`, such that `graph.RECEIVERS[i]` are the indices of the nodes
    receiving from the i-th edge.
    Observe that the index is absolute (in other words, cumulative), i.e.
    `graphs.RECEIVERS` take value in `[0, n_nodes]`. For instance, an edge
    connecting the vertices with relative indices 2 and 3 in the second graph of
    the batch would have a `RECEIVERS` value of `3 + graph.N_NODE[0]`.
    If `graphs.RECEIVERS` is `None`, then `graphs.EDGES` and `graphs.SENDERS`
    should also be `None`.
  - SENDERS: The indices of the sender nodes, for each edge. It is either
    `None` (if the graph has no edges), or a matrix of integers of shape
    `[n_edges]`, such that `graph.SENDERS[i]` are the indices of the nodes
    sending from the i-th edge.
    Observe that the index is absolute, i.e. `graphs.RECEIVERS` take value in
    `[0, n_nodes]`. For instance, an edge connecting the vertices with relative
    indices 1 and 3 in the third graph of the batch would have a `SENDERS` value
    of `1 + graph.N_NODE[0] + graph.N_NODE[1]`.
    If `graphs.SENDERS` is `None`, then `graphs.EDGES` and `graphs.RECEIVERS`
    should also be `None`.
  - GLOBALS: The global features of the graph. It is either `None` (the graph
    has no global features), or a vector of shape `[n_graphs] + global_shape`
    representing graph level features.
