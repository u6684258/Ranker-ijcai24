"""
General modules using the edge, node and global blocks defined in blocks.py

Based heavily off models implemented in Tensorflow by Deepmind.
https://github.com/deepmind/graph_nets/blob/master/graph_nets/modules.py

Each PyTorch module here takes a HypergraphsTuple as input, and returns a
HypergraphsTuple as output (with the updated values).
